Here is provided a basic Documentation for the project scripts.

**Disclaimer**: with respect to usual code docs, this documentation doesn't provide specific details on classes and variables. Instead, it focuses on the role of each script, and therefore it is only meant as a reference that allows tracing a given game behaviour/option to a given code block, such that any modification to a task can be applied and implemented in a more straightforward way.

**List of scripts**:

Task management:
- MainTask;
- Movement;

Data saving:
- Saver;
- Database scripts;

Video recording:
- ffMPEG modified scripts;

Connection to experimental setup:
- Arduino
- Ardu;
- Pupil Lab related scripts;

Scene creation:
- Ground;
- Createtargetsandtrees;
- Rocks;





## Task management

The following scripts manage the parameters and options of the task, the behaviour of the player (specifically, its motion).
