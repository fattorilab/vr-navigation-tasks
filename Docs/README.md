**Disclaimer**: with respect to usual code docs, this documentation doesn't provide specific details on classes and variables. Instead, it focuses on the role of each script, and therefore it is only meant as a reference that allows tracing a given game behaviour/option to a given code block, such that any modification to a task can be applied and implemented in a more straightforward way.
