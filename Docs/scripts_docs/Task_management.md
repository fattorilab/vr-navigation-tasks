## Task management

The following scripts manage the parameters and options of the task, and the behaviour of the player (specifically, its motion).

For the general list: [beam me up, Scotty!](../README.md)

### MainTask.cs

Implements the task as a state-machine, with a standard structure:
- state -2 PRETRIAL: where connections to Arduino and Pupil Labs recording are checked, visited only once after the first frame;
- state -1 INTERTRIAL: phase between trials (i.e. after start, it only follows an error/reward), depicts a black rectangular marker at the center of the camera for the purpose of syncing the videos and the Unity timestamps;
- state 0 BASELINE: where the trial is prepared, in particular the condition for the current trial is choosen (for condition-based tasks);
- state 1 to N: the sequence of states that follows depends on the specific task and can vary (see tasks_design.pdf for more details).
- state +99: Reward, end of trial.
- state -99: Error, end of trial.

Upon the start of the session (first frame, before state -2), it activates the neural recording by OpenEphys. 
Upon the end of the session (application quit), it stops the neural recording.

Acting as a main controller, it allows the customization of the task (e.g length of reward; epochs duration, disposition of the targets, etc), and tracking of the session (NÂ° trials, current state, total conditions). On every update (and thereby frame), all the relevant info is passed on to the [Saver](./Data_saving.md#Saver) for saving.

**Mind that** only public fields can be customized in the Editor and are saved in the database session-specific entry.
Some fields are non-serialized so that they are not included in Json structure that is saved in the database (see [Saver](./Data_saving.md#Saver)).

Moreover, this script instantiates the targets (and obstacles, where the task requires) starting from a CSV file of positions (x, y, z), and shows/hides them according to the design of the task. It also instantiates the black marker that appears/disappears within the state -1 INTERTRIAL.
Similarly to frame-by-frame data, objects data is recorded as well. In this case, the MainTask uses a Saver method (i.e. `AddObjectEnd()`) to save info, including position, time of appearance and disappearance (not referring to instantiation, but proper visibility to the participant) of the object.
This script does NOT instantiate any other element of the scene (for that, check [scene creation](./Scene_creation.md)).

Check the regions `Methods`, and `Targets` (inside it) to find the code blocks that manage the instantiations (also, the region `Scene and Obstacles` for the tasks with obstacles)

**MainTask depends on**:
- Ardu.cs - to start/stop OpenEphys neural recording, and to send rewards upon trial success.
- Movement.cs - to check if the participant is moving or static (e.g `isMoving`), to check if the participant collided with an object (e.g. `hasCollided`);
- Saver.cs - to save data of objects at the time of appearance/disappearance.
- RequestController.cs - to check if the connection with Arduino is active;
- PupilDataStream.cs - to check if the connection with the eye recorder is active;

### Movement.cs

Controls the movement of the player, and its collision 
It receives joystick coordinates' data (x, y) from [Ardu](https://github.com/fattorilab/vr-navigation-tasks/blob/main/Docs/scripts_docs/Connection_to_setup.md#ardu) and moves the player accordingly, that is linearly for forward/backward shifts (+/- Y axis) and rotationally for lateral shifts (+/- X axis). If Arduino is not working, or the joystick is missing, it is possible to play with the arrow keys of the keyboard.

This script also manages collisions with GameObjects, i.e. records/resets a collision, and the time of contact.

Finally, it allows restriction of movement in a given direction (e.g. to make the player static at one state or another), as well as inversion of the axes.
